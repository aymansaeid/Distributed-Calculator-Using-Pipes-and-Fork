# Distributed-Calculator-Using-Pipes-and-Fork
Distributed Calculator Using Pipes and Fork - C Programming language (assignment)
Distributed Calculator Using Pipes and Fork This project involved the creation of a distributed calculator system implemented inC. The system performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, anddivision) using separate processes for each operation. The main programcommunicates withthese subprocesses through pipes to send data and retrieve results. Additionally, a separatesaver process stores the results in a text file.
